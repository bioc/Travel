For using Travel, you need to install its dependences.

For *Windows*:

1. [Dokan](https://dokan-dev.github.io/)

It is recommended to download `DokanSetup-noVC.exe` for this is the library that
the Travel package has been tested with.

For *Linux* and *Mac*:

1. [fuse](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse)
2. [pkg-config](https://github.com/pkgconf/pkgconf)

Once the required library has been installed, the package should be able to compile and link against them automatically.
